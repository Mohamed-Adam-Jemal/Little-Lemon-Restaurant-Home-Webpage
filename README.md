# Little-Lemon-Restaurant-Home-Webpage

In this project, I tried to employ my front-end development skills by building a responsive webpage for a restaurant home page using HTML and CSS. To structure the content effectively, I used different HTML features, like semantic and meta tags, article elements, media elements, and anchor tags. In addition, I used several CSS features, such as box models, selectors, flex boxes, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, animations, keyframes, and transitions.
